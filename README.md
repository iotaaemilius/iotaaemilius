## Welcome to my Github

I am an history student with great interest in data analysis and exploration.
Currently I am studying in Berlin at the FU and HU.

You can find here mostly:
  1. ðŸ“š Papers on history
  2. ðŸ“Š Data analytics
  3. ðŸ’» Linux stuff

>[!CAUTION]
>I am completly self-taught my code will not be the best of the bunch.

### However:
If your are looking for someone motivated and enthuastic to contribute to your Open Source project, I will be readily available.
